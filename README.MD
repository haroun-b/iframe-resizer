## About

iframe Resizer is a simple browser extension which offers through its intuitive interface the ability to resize iframe elements embedded in a web page.
Simply select an iframe then use the popup's input fields to change its width and height. It is also possible to expand the iframe into full view.

The selected iframe will maintain its new size throughout the browsing session until it is discarded or until the tab is closed.
